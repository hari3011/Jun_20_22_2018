//Java is case sensitive
//File name and the class name should MATCH
//Execution starts with a main method
//Every line ends with a semicolon
//Printing on the console is System.out.println

//Like C# you have to write lot of code in Java also to do something useful
//Like C#, java is also bit retarded

//javac HelloWorld.java
//You get HelloWorld.class (contains bytecodes)
//"Write Once, Run Everywhere"
//java HelloWorld

public class HelloWorld{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
			System.out.println("Hello World");
		}
	}
}
