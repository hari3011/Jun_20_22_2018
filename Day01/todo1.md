* Move away from STS. Let's use notepad for this exercise
* Create a file Parent.java with the following code.

```java

package com.gbig.day01;
public class Parent{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello Parent");
	}
}

```

* Compile this file *Parent.java* and observe the **.class** file generated
* Run *Parent* class and discuss what's going on
